      "body": "Our two academy sides had fixtures on the weekend and you can see everything in one place with Academy Action!Jack Wilshere’s under-18s began their U18 Premier League Cup group with a 1-1 draw against West Ham United, while Mehmet Ali’s under-21s got back to winning ways with a 3-0 victory over Reading in Premier League 2.West Ham were reduced to ten men when goalkeeper Fin Herrick was sent off for a foul on Louie Copley outside the penalty area. He was replaced by left winger Liam Jones in goal.Jones spilled a Michal Rosiak free-kick into the path of Harrison Dudziak, who gave us the lead, but the away side responded courtesy of Josh Ajala. With Derby County and Middlesbrough drawing their game 2-2 in Group B of the U18 Premier League Cup, we are all level on one point after one round of matches."
